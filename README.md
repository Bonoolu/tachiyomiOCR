# Tachiyomi OCR

[![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/rattlehead15/tachiyomiOCR?label=download&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Rattlehead15/tachiyomiOCR/releases)

This is a fork of the popular manga reader Tachiyomi, which adds OCR and Dictionary lookup features to the reader to make the process of learning Japanese with manga easier.

## Added features

* Popup dictionary to quickly look up unknown words. Supports deinflection of verbs and adjectives.
* OCR (Optical character recognition) to quickly search words without having to write them.

## Usage
Tachiyomi OCR adds two new buttons in the reader menu, the dictionary button and the OCR button.
 - The dictionary button is straightforward, it opens up the dictionary and you can look up any word you want.
 - When the OCR button is pressed, you will be prompted to select the region of the screen which contains the word you want to look for. Once the region is selected, long press the OCR rectangle to scan the word and look it up in the dictionary
 - Dictionary entries have an Anki button in the upper right corner. If you set up your card export correctly in the settings, this button can be pressed to export the word definitions to ankiDroid

## Planned features
* Hiragana word lookup (currently only words written in kanji work)
* Support for other languages (japanese-only at the moment)

## Special thanks to
 * The tachiyomi devs for, well almost everything
 * The [Kaku](https://github.com/0xbad1d3a5/Kaku) devs for the deinflection code and various design ideas. Definitely recommend Kaku for OCR outside of Tachiyomi
 * [Flaticon](https://flaticon.com) for the ocr and dictionary icons
